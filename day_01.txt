1. Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 ? 

HTTP1.1 

It works on the textual format.  
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2 

It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It uses HPACK for data compression.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ? 

Objects are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript. They are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. 
Objects are made up of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any data type, including other objects.
Internally, objects in JavaScript are typically represented using hash tables. A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. 
The keys are typically strings, and the values can be any data type. Hash tables are very efficient for storing and retrieving data, 
because they can use a hashing algorithm to quickly find the location of a value based on its key.
When you create an object in JavaScript, the engine allocates memory to store the object and its properties. 
The engine then uses a hashing algorithm to map the keys to their associated values. The keys are stored in a hash table, and the values are stored in an array. 
The array is indexed by the hash value of the key.

3.  CodeKata practise done. 

4. Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address.
